        The concept of a meta-universe, also known as a metaverse, has become a
        hotly debated topic in recent years. Essentially, a meta-universe is a
        virtual reality environment that allows users to interact with each
        other in a shared digital space. The idea has been popularized in
        science fiction, with works such as "Snow Crash" and "Ready Player One"
        depicting vast, immersive virtual worlds where people can escape from
        reality and explore new experiences. However, the concept has also been
        the subject of intense scrutiny and debate, with concerns raised about
        issues such as privacy, addiction, and the potential impact on social
        and economic systems. Despite these concerns, many technologists and
        entrepreneurs are excited about the potential of the meta-universe to
        transform entertainment, commerce, and social interaction, and the race
        to create the first fully-realized meta-universe is well underway.

        To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the metaverse”
        can be, here's an exercise: Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse”
        in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning
        won't substantially change. That's because the term doesn't really refer
        to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad (and often
        speculative) shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely
        possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated,
        even as the specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Broadly speaking, the technologies companies refer to when they talk
        about “the metaverse” can include virtual reality—characterized by
        persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you're not
        playing—as well as augmented reality that combines aspects of the
        digital and physical worlds. However, it doesn't require that those
        spaces be exclusively accessed via VR or AR. Virtual worlds—such as
        aspects of Fortnite that can be accessed through PCs, game consoles, and
        even phones—have started referring to themselves as “the metaverse.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many companies that have hopped on board the metaverse bandwagon also
        envision some sort of new digital economy, where users can create, buy,
        and sell goods. In the more idealistic visions of the metaverse, it's
        interoperable, allowing you to take virtual items like clothes or cars
        from one platform to another, though this is harder than it sounds.
        While some advocates claim new technologies like NFTs can enable
        portable digital assets, this simply isn't true, and bringing items from
        one video game or virtual world to another is an enormously complex task
        that no one company can solve. It's difficult to parse what all this
        means because when you hear descriptions like those above, an
        understandable response is, “Wait, doesn't that exist already?” World of
        Warcraft, for example, is a persistent virtual world where players can
        buy and sell goods. Fortnite has virtual experiences like concerts and
        an exhibit where Rick Sanchez can learn about MLK Jr. You can strap on
        an Oculus headset and be in your own personal virtual home. Is that
        really what “the metaverse” means? Just some new kinds of video games?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Well, yes and no. Saying that Fortnite is “the metaverse” would be a bit
        like saying Google is “the internet.” Even if you spend large chunks of
        time in Fortnite, socializing, buying things, learning, and playing
        games, that doesn't necessarily mean it encompasses the entire scope of
        what people and companies mean when they say "the metaverse." Just as
        Google, which builds parts of the internet—from physical data centers to
        security layers—isn't the entire internet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta are working on building tech related
        to interacting with virtual worlds, but they're not the only ones. Many
        other large companies, including Nvidia, Unity, Roblox, and even Snap—as
        well as a variety of smaller companies and startups—are building the
        infrastructure to create better virtual worlds that more closely mimic
        our physical life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, Epic has acquired a number of companies that help create or
        distribute digital assets, in part to bolster its powerful Unreal Engine
        5 platform. And while Unreal may be a video game platform, it's also
        being used in the film industry and could make it easier for anyone to
        create virtual experiences. There are tangible and exciting developments
        in the realm of building digital worlds. Despite this, the idea of a
        Ready Player One-like single unified place called “the metaverse" is
        still largely impossible. That is in part because such a world requires
        companies to cooperate in a way that simply isn't profitable or
        desirable—Fortnite doesn't have much motivation to give players a portal
        to jump straight over to World of Warcraft, even if it were easy to do
        so, for example—and partially because the raw computing power needed for
        such a concept could be much further away than we think.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This inconvenient fact has given rise to slightly different terminology.
        Now many companies or advocates instead refer to any single game or
        platform as “a metaverse.” By this definition, anything from a VR
        concert app to a video game would count as a “metaverse.” Some take it
        further, calling the collection of various metaverses a “multiverse of
        metaverses.” Or maybe we're living in a “hybrid-verse.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Or these words can mean anything at all. Coca-Cola launched a “flavor
        born in the metaverse” alongside a Fortnite tie-in mini-game. There are
        no rules.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's at this point that most discussions of what the metaverse entails
        start to stall. We have a vague sense of what things currently exist
        that we could kind of call the metaverse if we massage the definition of
        words the right way. And we know which companies are investing in the
        idea, but after months, there's nothing approaching agreement on what it
        is. Meta thinks it will include fake houses you can invite all your
        friends to hang out in. Microsoft seems to think it could involve
        virtual meeting rooms to train new hires or chat with your remote
        coworkers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The pitches for these visions of the future range from optimistic to
        outright fan fiction. At one point during Meta's original presentation
        on the metaverse, the company showed a scenario in which a young woman
        is sitting on her couch scrolling through Instagram when she sees a
        video a friend posted of a concert that's happening halfway across the
        world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The video then cuts to the concert, where the woman appears in an
        Avengers-style hologram. She's able to make eye contact with her friend
        who is physically there, they're both able to hear the concert, and they
        can see floating text hovering above the stage. This seems cool, but
        it's not really advertising a real product, or even a possible future
        one. In fact, it brings us to the biggest problem with “the metaverse.”

    <div id="content2-1">
      <p>Last week, Meta (the umbrella company formerly known as Facebook) 
        opened up access to its virtual-reality social media platform, Horizon 
        Worlds. Early descriptions of the platform make it seem fun and wholesome,
        drawing comparisons to Minecraft. In Horizon Worlds, up to 20 avatars can 
        get together at a time to explore, hang out, and build within the virtual space.</p>
        <br>
      <p>But not everything has been warm and fuzzy. According to Meta, on November 26, a beta 
        tester reported something deeply troubling: she had been groped by a stranger on Horizon 
        Worlds. On December 1, Meta revealed that she’d posted her experience in the Horizon Worlds 
        beta testing group on Facebook.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Meta’s internal review of the incident found that the beta tester should have 
        used a tool called “Safe Zone” that’s part of a suite of safety features built 
        into Horizon Worlds. Safe Zone is a protective bubble users can activate when 
        feeling threatened. Within it, no one can touch them, talk to them, or interact 
        in any way until they signal that they would like the Safe Zone lifted.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Vivek Sharma, the vice president of Horizon, called the groping incident “absolutely 
        unfortunate,” telling The Verge, “That’s good feedback still for us because I want to 
        make [the blocking feature] trivially easy and findable.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>It’s not the first time a user has been groped in VR—nor, unfortunately, will it be the 
        last. But the incident shows that until companies work out how to protect participants, 
        the metaverse can never be a safe place.</p>
      <br>
      <p>“There I was, being virtually groped”’.</p>
      <br>
      <p>When Aaron Stanton heard about the incident at Meta, he was transported to October 2016. 
        That was when a gamer, Jordan Belamire, penned an open letter on Medium describing being groped 
        in Quivr, a game Stanton co-designed in which players, equipped with bow and arrows, shoot zombies.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>In the letter, Belamire described entering a multiplayer mode, where all characters were exactly 
        the same save for their voices. “In between a wave of zombies and demons to shoot down, I was 
        hanging out next to BigBro442, waiting for our next attack. Suddenly, BigBro442’s disembodied 
        helmet faced me dead-on. His floating hand approached my body, and he started to virtually rub 
        my chest. ‘Stop!’ I cried … This goaded him on, and even when I turned away from him, he chased 
        me around, making grabbing and pinching motions near my chest. Emboldened, he even shoved his 
        hand toward my virtual crotch and began rubbing.</p>
      <br>
      <p>“There I was, being virtually groped in a snowy fortress with my brother-in-law and husband watching.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stanton and his cofounder, Jonathan Schenker, immediately responded with an apology and an in-game fix. 
        Avatars would be able to stretch their arms into a V gesture, which would automatically push any offenders away.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Stanton, who today leads the VR Institute for Health and Exercise, says Quivr didn’t track data about that feature, 
        “nor do I think it was used much.” But Stanton thinks about Belamire often and wonders if he could have done more in 
        2016 to prevent the incident that occurred in Horizon Worlds a few weeks ago. “There’s so much more to be done here,” 
        he says. “No one should ever have to flee from a VR experience to escape feeling powerless.”</p>

    </div>
    
    <div id="content2-2">
      <h6>VR sexual harassment is sexual harassment, full stop</h6>
      <p>A recent review of the events around Belamire’s experience 
        published in the journal for the Digital Games Research Association 
        found that “many online responses to this incident were dismissive of 
        Belamire’s experience and, at times, abusive and misogynistic … readers 
        from all perspectives grappled with understanding this act given the virtual 
        and playful context it occurred in.” Belamire faded from view, and I was 
        unable to find her online.</p>
      <br>
      <p>A constant topic of debate on message boards after Belamire’s Medium article 
        was whether or not what she had experienced was actually groping if her body 
        wasn’t physically touched.</p>
      <br>
      <p>“I think people should keep in mind that sexual harassment has never had to 
        be a physical thing,” says Jesse Fox, an associate professor at Ohio State 
        University who researches the social implications of virtual reality. “It 
        can be verbal, and yes, it can be a virtual experience as well.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Katherine Cross, who researches online harassment at the University of 
        Washington, says that when virtual reality is immersive and real, toxic 
        behavior that occurs in that environment is real as well. “At the end 
        of the day, the nature of virtual-reality spaces is such that it is designed 
        to trick the user into thinking they are physically in a certain space, that 
        their every bodily action is occurring in a 3D environment,” she says. 
        “It’s part of the reason why emotional reactions can be stronger in that 
        space, and why VR triggers the same internal nervous system and psychological responses.”
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>That was true in the case of the woman who was groped on Horizon Worlds. According to The 
        Verge, her post read: “Sexual harassment is no joke on the regular internet, but being in VR 
        adds another layer that makes the event more intense. Not only was I groped last night, but 
        there were other people there who supported this behavior which made me feel isolated in the 
        Plaza [the virtual environment’s central gathering space].”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Sexual assault and harassment in virtual worlds is not new, nor is it realistic to expect a
         world in which these issues will completely disappear. So long as there are people who will 
         hide behind their computer screens to evade moral responsibility, they will continue to occur.</p>
      <br>
      <p>The real problem, perhaps, has to do with the perception that when you play a game or participate in 
        a virtual world, there’s what Stanton describes as a “contract between developer and player.” “As a player, 
        I’m agreeing to being able to do what I want in the developer’s world according to their rules,” he says. “But 
        as soon as that contract is broken and I’m not feeling comfortable anymore, the obligation of the company is 
        to return the player to wherever they want to be and back to being comfortable.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>The question is: Whose responsibility is it to make sure users are comfortable? Meta, for example, says it gives 
        users access to tools to keep themselves safe, effectively shifting the onus onto them.
      </p>
      <br>
      <p>“We want everyone in Horizon Worlds to have a positive experience with safety tools that are easy to find—and it’s 
        never a user's fault if they don’t use all the features we offer,” Meta spokesperson Kristina Milian said. “We will 
        continue to improve our UI and to better understand how people use our tools so that users are able to report things 
        easily and reliably. Our goal is to make Horizon Worlds safe, and we are committed to doing that work.”</p>
      <br>
      <p>Milian said that users must undergo an onboarding process prior to joining Horizon Worlds that teaches them how to 
        launch Safe Zone. She also said regular reminders are loaded into screens and posters within Horizon Worlds.</p>
