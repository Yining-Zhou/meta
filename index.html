        The concept of a meta-universe, also known as a metaverse, has become a
        hotly debated topic in recent years. Essentially, a meta-universe is a
        virtual reality environment that allows users to interact with each
        other in a shared digital space. The idea has been popularized in
        science fiction, with works such as "Snow Crash" and "Ready Player One"
        depicting vast, immersive virtual worlds where people can escape from
        reality and explore new experiences. However, the concept has also been
        the subject of intense scrutiny and debate, with concerns raised about
        issues such as privacy, addiction, and the potential impact on social
        and economic systems. Despite these concerns, many technologists and
        entrepreneurs are excited about the potential of the meta-universe to
        transform entertainment, commerce, and social interaction, and the race
        to create the first fully-realized meta-universe is well underway.

        To help you get a sense of how vague and complex a term “the metaverse”
        can be, here's an exercise: Mentally replace the phrase “the metaverse”
        in a sentence with “cyberspace.” Ninety percent of the time, the meaning
        won't substantially change. That's because the term doesn't really refer
        to any one specific type of technology, but rather a broad (and often
        speculative) shift in how we interact with technology. And it's entirely
        possible that the term itself will eventually become just as antiquated,
        even as the specific technology it once described becomes commonplace.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Broadly speaking, the technologies companies refer to when they talk
        about “the metaverse” can include virtual reality—characterized by
        persistent virtual worlds that continue to exist even when you're not
        playing—as well as augmented reality that combines aspects of the
        digital and physical worlds. However, it doesn't require that those
        spaces be exclusively accessed via VR or AR. Virtual worlds—such as
        aspects of Fortnite that can be accessed through PCs, game consoles, and
        even phones—have started referring to themselves as “the metaverse.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Many companies that have hopped on board the metaverse bandwagon also
        envision some sort of new digital economy, where users can create, buy,
        and sell goods. In the more idealistic visions of the metaverse, it's
        interoperable, allowing you to take virtual items like clothes or cars
        from one platform to another, though this is harder than it sounds.
        While some advocates claim new technologies like NFTs can enable
        portable digital assets, this simply isn't true, and bringing items from
        one video game or virtual world to another is an enormously complex task
        that no one company can solve. It's difficult to parse what all this
        means because when you hear descriptions like those above, an
        understandable response is, “Wait, doesn't that exist already?” World of
        Warcraft, for example, is a persistent virtual world where players can
        buy and sell goods. Fortnite has virtual experiences like concerts and
        an exhibit where Rick Sanchez can learn about MLK Jr. You can strap on
        an Oculus headset and be in your own personal virtual home. Is that
        really what “the metaverse” means? Just some new kinds of video games?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Well, yes and no. Saying that Fortnite is “the metaverse” would be a bit
        like saying Google is “the internet.” Even if you spend large chunks of
        time in Fortnite, socializing, buying things, learning, and playing
        games, that doesn't necessarily mean it encompasses the entire scope of
        what people and companies mean when they say "the metaverse." Just as
        Google, which builds parts of the internet—from physical data centers to
        security layers—isn't the entire internet.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Tech giants like Microsoft and Meta are working on building tech related
        to interacting with virtual worlds, but they're not the only ones. Many
        other large companies, including Nvidia, Unity, Roblox, and even Snap—as
        well as a variety of smaller companies and startups—are building the
        infrastructure to create better virtual worlds that more closely mimic
        our physical life.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        For example, Epic has acquired a number of companies that help create or
        distribute digital assets, in part to bolster its powerful Unreal Engine
        5 platform. And while Unreal may be a video game platform, it's also
        being used in the film industry and could make it easier for anyone to
        create virtual experiences. There are tangible and exciting developments
        in the realm of building digital worlds. Despite this, the idea of a
        Ready Player One-like single unified place called “the metaverse" is
        still largely impossible. That is in part because such a world requires
        companies to cooperate in a way that simply isn't profitable or
        desirable—Fortnite doesn't have much motivation to give players a portal
        to jump straight over to World of Warcraft, even if it were easy to do
        so, for example—and partially because the raw computing power needed for
        such a concept could be much further away than we think.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This inconvenient fact has given rise to slightly different terminology.
        Now many companies or advocates instead refer to any single game or
        platform as “a metaverse.” By this definition, anything from a VR
        concert app to a video game would count as a “metaverse.” Some take it
        further, calling the collection of various metaverses a “multiverse of
        metaverses.” Or maybe we're living in a “hybrid-verse.”
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Or these words can mean anything at all. Coca-Cola launched a “flavor
        born in the metaverse” alongside a Fortnite tie-in mini-game. There are
        no rules.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        It's at this point that most discussions of what the metaverse entails
        start to stall. We have a vague sense of what things currently exist
        that we could kind of call the metaverse if we massage the definition of
        words the right way. And we know which companies are investing in the
        idea, but after months, there's nothing approaching agreement on what it
        is. Meta thinks it will include fake houses you can invite all your
        friends to hang out in. Microsoft seems to think it could involve
        virtual meeting rooms to train new hires or chat with your remote
        coworkers.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The pitches for these visions of the future range from optimistic to
        outright fan fiction. At one point during Meta's original presentation
        on the metaverse, the company showed a scenario in which a young woman
        is sitting on her couch scrolling through Instagram when she sees a
        video a friend posted of a concert that's happening halfway across the
        world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        The video then cuts to the concert, where the woman appears in an
        Avengers-style hologram. She's able to make eye contact with her friend
        who is physically there, they're both able to hear the concert, and they
        can see floating text hovering above the stage. This seems cool, but
        it's not really advertising a real product, or even a possible future
        one. In fact, it brings us to the biggest problem with “the metaverse.”
