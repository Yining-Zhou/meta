        “When you go to buy a blind box from the store, you mainly want to shake it and guess, just to be happy.”
        <span>“Blind boxes for gifts are not expensive, have a good sense of design, are tasteful, and are not easily duplicated.”</span>
        “I like the feeling of walking and meeting a store and suddenly coming up with 'ah, I want to buy', I can immediately turn the idea into reality, and there will be some kind of unanticipated joy.”
        <span>“When you take time to open the box, touch the beautifully designed and textured dolls, you will feel the pressure of reality is eaten up. The dolls carry the memories of childhood, their existence is to convey happiness.”</span>
        “Buy one by one always feel actually not expensive, opening blind box is also quite exciting.”</h1>
